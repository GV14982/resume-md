## Volunteer

### PHLask

[PHLask](https://phlask.me/) is an application that aims to make
finding free resources easier. We recently completed
dev work on our v2 application that will allow people to search
for water, foraging, food, and clothing

### PHL Code Club

I co-organize a monthly meetup in
Philadelphia called [PHL Code Club](https://phlcode.club).
Our focus is interactive sessions,
but we also like to do project showcases or
more traditional talks from time to time. It has
been awesome to improve my communication
and continue learning while building a
community of like minded people. It has also given me
opportunities to mentor and teach others individually.

## Talks

### Typesafe APIs powered by GraphQL

Explained the basics of the syntax,
type system, execution, and some
pros and cons of GraphQL over other HTTP API types.
Emphasized the ease of use when
paired with code generation and the self documenting
nature via introspection queries.

### Gleam for Typescript Developers

Introduced the Gleam programming
language as well as a short
introduction to functional
programming. Compared common
patterns in Typescript with their
Gleam counterparts.

### Vim Motions: For Fun and Profit

Presented the basics of vim motions, operators and marks.
Then I did a short demo with a widget to show my keystrokes.
Fielded a bunch of great questions about vim, text editing, and terminals in general.

## Education

### Degree in Computer Science: 2014
